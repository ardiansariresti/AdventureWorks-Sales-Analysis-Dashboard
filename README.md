# AdventureWorks Sales Analysis Dashboard

This project was created while learning Power BI through an online course on Udemy.  
It’s an interactive dashboard that explores Adventure Works sales data from 2005–2014.

## 📊 Overview

The dashboard focuses on analyzing sales performance by different dimensions such as product, region, education, promotion, and gender.  
I also added some interactive elements to make the report more flexible and user-friendly.

## 🔹 Key Features

### 1. Dynamic Metrics
A parameter was used to switch between three main measures:
- **Total Sales**
- **Total Cost**
- **Gross Profit**

When a different metric is selected, all visuals on the page update automatically.  
This makes it easier to view the same analysis from different perspectives.

### 2. Tooltip Page
A custom tooltip shows detailed information when hovering over visuals:
- Internet Sales (total, cost, margin, % margin)
- Reseller Sales (total, cost, margin, % margin)

This tooltip gives a quick breakdown without leaving the main dashboard.

### 3. Country Filter with Flag Slicers
Used the **Chiclet Slicer** visual to display each country as a clickable flag button.  
Supports **multi-selection** for comparing multiple countries at once.

### 4. Date Filter
Users can filter the date range between **2005–2014**.
